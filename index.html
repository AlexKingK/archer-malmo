	<p>
	Today for our field trip, our class is going to Archer Malmo. I got to school and went to math. I went into math and found out there was a test. I was not ready for the test. I was in the middle of the test and didn't answer 6 of the 20 question. I tried to ask a question  about the test but she did not want to answer it. After failing the test we went to second period. We didn't know what to know with our bags. We ask our teacher to take our bags to the classroom and drop it off. We started walking around the school and not knowing what to do. We than got a text saying meet in the main office after the class. The bell rang and we went to the office. We saw everyone and stood there and waited. We were just hanging out with our friends and waiting for the bus. We got on the bus and the bus smelled bad. We were riding the bus and talking on the bus. We finally got downtown and were going through the small roads. after a while we arrived.</p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center;" class="animated fadeInDown">The building</h2>
	<p>We walked in the very nice building and were amazed on the inside. We went to a elevator and took turns going up it. We then went to a office room and a guy did a very boring presentation. Some of us fell asleep. After the presentation we went up stairs and we saw what they did. Then we went down stairs and saw where they do animation and film. Then we went down the elevator and went to the bus spot. We waited for the bus in the freezing cold and we getting mad.</p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center;" class="animated fadeInDown">Cook out</h2>
	<p>The bus finally came and we went to cook out. There was the longest line in the restaurant. There were people leaving because there were some many people in the restaurant. I finally got up to the desk and order my food. We waited all around for our food. After sometime we all finally got our food. We all sat down and started to eat. We were making jokes and talking about what happen. We went to the bathroom and wrote our name on the wall and we all laughed. After that I tried some cheese cake and did not like it. Then I tried a Milkshake also did not like that. I gave it a away to Ari and he ate it. We had some more people come over to our table we took a group pho.to. After that we got on the bus to go back to school.</p>
